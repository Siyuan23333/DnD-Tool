### Description
I plan to create a Python-based local platform for playing DnD adventures. It aims to help DMs and players organize information about characters and encounters. It is expected to simplify and accelerate combats by automatically managing initiative and calculating damages. A database about monsters and items should be connected to the platform, allowing users to check the information at any time. This platform is fully oriented towards DnD, making it more concise and convenient to use than other platforms.
